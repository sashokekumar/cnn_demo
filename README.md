# CNN Deep Learning Demo

A hands-on CNN tutorial with toy data and complete data visualization.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Generate toy images:**
   ```bash
   python generate_toy_images.py
   ```

3. **Run the CNN with exhaustive outputs:**
   ```bash
   python cnn_demo_toy_story_exhaustive.py
   ```

4. **Check generated outputs:**
   - Look in `cnn_demo_story_outputs_exhaustive/` for all CSV files showing intermediate tensor values

5. **Get the instructional guide:**
   - Open a Copilot chat and give it the instruction from `COPILOT_CNN_INSTRUCTOR.md`
   - The agent will generate a comprehensive educational guide with all explanations
   - Everything after that is self-explanatory story—read and learn!
